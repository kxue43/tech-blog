The articles here contain very few technical innovations if any. Most of the ideas
presented are already widely circulating in the form of books, blog posts, online
presentations and Stack Overflow discussions. I personally benefit from open-source
software, and I want to reciprocate by writing up some articles, with the sole hope
that they might be helpful alternative expositions of existing knowledge in the
public domain. All opinions are mine and do not represent any other individuals
or organizations.
